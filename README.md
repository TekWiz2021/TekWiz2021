### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**TekWiz2021/TekWiz2021** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Winfile.exe Updated See Install... Looking to add new file to menu ( Right Click )  
cmd   set>newfile.txt  works nice to make a new file no errors
would like to add it to the right click menu. 
I changed a bunch of cosmetics in my version of Winfile.exe
You can get a command prompt CMD by just pressing Ctrl k  ...Ctrl p for Powershell.
